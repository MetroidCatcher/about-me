First and foremost, this text may be seen from some as passive aggressive. It may is, but I'm being respectful here, not swearing or anything.

## Very short version why I left Twitter
Elon Musk does weird and nonsensical changes to it.
## Long version why I left Twitter
- He is making the Platform worse for normal, non-paying users
- Removing features that was previously free, requires now a Twitter Blue subscription
- Twitter Blue aka "verification" fiasco itself, creating exactly this "Lords and peasants"-system, aka it is more corrupted than it was before
- The algorithm is pushing those, who are paying
- Also the algorithm is pushing Elon Musk tweets by default (Cause he don't have enough reach by default, before these big brain changes, huh...)
- The algorithm is punishing those, if you're muting(?) or blocking them, really demote them into oblivion
- Elon Musk acts like he is not an adult
- He apparently claims he is the "smartest" person in the building, if he is in the building, which I don't see that at all
- Since the tookover, Bots, Cryptobros and NFTbros are more active than before (maybe just subjectively), which he claimed he wants to fight them on the platform, again, I don't see this
- Like the reason above, he is likely to push his "Twitter Blue"-subscription thing to "fight" bots, well, it works horribly
- The prices for the API access are just lunatic, like ????
- Elon should pay those who are actually spending their life and time being on there, instead of paying him<br>
(Oh, he's so broke, have some sympathy. ðŸ¥º No, I don't, thanks. ðŸ™„)
